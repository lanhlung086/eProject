                detailedReview: [
                    "Installation was relatively easy, the instructions and the labeling on the wires and the connections were easy to follow and the whole installation took under 2 hours, including the time to disassamble and remove the old ceiling fan. The new fan looks great, the light is fairly bright and has a reasonable light temperature - not too cold, but not too soft either. The remote is already programmed and you won't need to reprogram it unless you have another Minka ceiling fan in your home that you want to control separately. Compared to my previous ceiling fan, this one needs to spin faster to deliver the same airflow, since it has 3 blades, compared to 5, and the blade angle is smaller. This is not an issue as this fan spins very fast when you use the highest setting (6), but it is a bit noisier, though it doesn't bother me much. All in all, this is a great looking fan and the materials and build are high quality. The blades are made of what seems like plastic, but it immitates wood pretty good, and reduces the weight and is more efficient, plus the blades will be much less prone to warping over time. The housing around the light is metal and the base is sturdy and leaves enough room to hide the wiring.",

                    "Second, it isn't possible to control the fan/ light using your wall switch. We have a smart house with hue lights and a google device in every room- so I get it. However, it should be possible to turn on your bedroom light without having to open the app on your phone or look for the remote.",

                    "The fan is super quiet, pretty, and has the Bond Home tech built in so you can control it with an app or your voice assistant. The low setting is very low, which is something I personally like very much, and the high setting moves quite a bit of air. Finally, the remote leaves something to be desired as it is too easy to accidentally change the fan's direction and you cannot dim the light with it (must be done in the app). I think it is fair to knock a star off for this because I think a product like this is at its best when it is full featured out of the box. While wifi setup is pretty simple, not everyone has the patience for it or is comfortable with having connected devices. Overall very happy with this purchase despite the remote.",
