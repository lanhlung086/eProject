                    "Installation was relatively easy, the instructions and the labeling on the wires and the connections were easy to follow and the whole installation took under 2 hours, including the time to disassamble and remove the old ceiling fan. The new fan looks great, the light is fairly bright and has a reasonable light temperature - not too cold, but not too soft either. The remote is already programmed and you won't need to reprogram it unless you have another Minka ceiling fan in your home that you want to control separately. Compared to my previous ceiling fan, this one needs to spin faster to deliver the same airflow, since it has 3 blades, compared to 5, and the blade angle is smaller. This is not an issue as this fan spins very fast when you use the highest setting (6), but it is a bit noisier, though it doesn't bother me much. All in all, this is a great looking fan and the materials and build are high quality. The blades are made of what seems like plastic, but it immitates wood pretty good, and reduces the weight and is more efficient, plus the blades will be much less prone to warping over time. The housing around the light is metal and the base is sturdy and leaves enough room to hide the wiring.",

                    "The fan is super quiet, pretty, and has the Bond Home tech built in so you can control it with an app or your voice assistant. The low setting is very low, which is something I personally like very much, and the high setting moves quite a bit of air. Finally, the remote leaves something to be desired as it is too easy to accidentally change the fan's direction and you cannot dim the light with it (must be done in the app). I think it is fair to knock a star off for this because I think a product like this is at its best when it is full featured out of the box. While wifi setup is pretty simple, not everyone has the patience for it or is comfortable with having connected devices. Overall very happy with this purchase despite the remote.",

If you need a lot of light you will need to install canned light with it. We put one in our bedroom, and itâs perfect. In our second bedroom we added lighting so that would be helpful if we had an office in there, or say a child needed to do homework in there. UPDATE: Donât buy the wall control. It has a horrible bright blue light that you CAN NOT turn off. When I say bright, I mean you wonât be able to sleep bright! Who could come up with such a bad idea.

We knew what we were getting in to with the light based on other reviews here (itâs completely useless except as a nightlight) but were disappointed to find that it also doesnât function well as a fan. At least the two-bladed version just doesnât move much air so you have to put it on high just to get any kind of reasonable airflow and then itâs sort of loud (the motor makes a humming sound on high, itâs totally silent on low or medium).

                    " Not much of a problem to install. I did it myself, but I would recommend an assistant. Use commonsense with safety to make a secure and strong mount and donât skip the safety hanging cable to the ceiling joist. I had to knock off a star because of the dismal lighting; nearly useless. Otherwise, it works fine so far and looks fantastic. My grandson absolutely loves it. One reviewer mentioned a remote control, but that must be a different ceiling fan because there is no sign of one with this product. With past reviews making note of the fan failing to work, weâll wait and see how long this one will work and Iâll post an update if necessary.",

                    " I purchased this fan for looks over functionality and it did not disappoint. It looks awesome in my sonâs room. I was pleasantly surprised that it had a built in light. The light is not very bright, but does the trick. The fan itself has multiple speeds and a reverse function for winter. My only gripe about this fan is the lack of a remote control which is normally found on cheaper Home Depot models. However, I had this fan professionally installed and the electrician was able to setup two wall switches; one switch controls the light (on and off) and another switch controls the fan (on and off).",

The motor would start up ok then it would freeze. So I took the fan to an authorized dealer to see if they could get the light off but even they could not. So I returned it and bought the exact same fan again and the new replacement which was put together by the electrician worked like a charm with no issues.

                    "This is not the best quality. The bad, blades are plastic, look ok, but for $199, dollars the price should reflect a upper level fan. The install was difficult, the remote transmitter has to fit in the canopy, VERY tight fit even with placing the wires up in the wiring box. In order to test the fan operation the switch housing has to be installed. Does not say that anywhere in the instructions. Lastly, the LED light did not work. Tested the electricity down to the LED, all looked fine but the light would not work. Looked at the fan companieâs warranty, that basically says, if there is a defective part, you have to send it back to the dealer. So, I got to put the fan all together, then take it apart, re-box it, and take it back to UPS. Waste of time. I canât in good conscience say that this is a good buy for the money. I could get a whole lot more fan for the money. That being said, I was willing to pay even more for the right fan. I liked the look of the fan, but will have to reconsider what my next purchase after having to return this one.",

                    "I have installed every imaginable fan design from A to Z and I really wanted to enjoy this fan. Unboxing was like \"this is a really nice fan and the manufacturing is much better than average\". Fit and finish of all the parts was impressive. It looked great installed on the new patio -used a heavy duty mounting box and the included downrod. First run had wobble on all three speeds. Used the balance kit per the instructions to no avail -the balance clip had zero positive change on the wobble and only worsened the condition no matter the position or blade placement. So here's the bottom line. Ceiling fans are no picnic to install -the next time I open a fan box and fins a balance kit, I'll return it immediately. There are manufactures that have addressed this ridiculous issue correctly. I'll be buying from them and live with the fact that they're not as attractive as Kichler.",

The ceiling thickness is 3/8\" and there is a gap that is not killed out using the trim ring. This may be okay for interior apps but this fan is rated for damp conditions ... why we bought it. The canopy is fixed (support screws on each side). Hmmm, get out the caulking. You should not have to do that. Installed many fans and thought we'd try a different brand. Will switch back. Poor product and customer service. Tried accessing customer service on Kichler.com. Looks like you need to call your dealer first and they will give you the phone number if needed. A big run around and don't think Amazon would be doing thatð. Over the time limit for a return otherwise would definitely return it",

                    "I have a few things I dislike about this fan. If you have a fan that uses one switch for a light and one for a fan, the control unit forces you to use just one switch to operate both, then you have to use the remote if you want one or the other on. Also the light is NOT dimmable because of this, but the description says it is. There is no dimming function on the remote.This is extremely annoying because the light is ridiculously bright as you can see from the picture. If you hard wired the light to your wall switch and installed a dimmer, that might work, but the remote would no longer work for the light. Also mine appears to have been a returned item, not new. It was not damaged but there were open packages inside and the wiring for the control unit was very frayed. Very disappointed for what's supposed to be a high end ceiling fan",

                    "I bought this fan to put outside at our Boat slip at the marina. We had a Hampton Bay 48 inch outdoor fan from Home Depot up but wanted a wider radius. The 48 inch fan had great RPM's and a great wind/breeze maker but was just not wide enough to cover our deck at the lake. So we opted for this 60 inch outdoor fan. We went to install it, on a 4 foot down pole, like the Hampton Bay 48 inch and found, unlike all other standard fans, it takes a 1/2 inch rod instead of the industry standard 3/8's inch rod. Well, they don't make one so we had to custom make one out of a 48 inch galvanized steel pole for plumbing. That worked fine.",
                    "However, once we had it installed, thats when we found the most disappointing thing. Unlike ALL ceiling fans we have owned for more than 25-30 years, this fan, ON HIGH, moved like most fans on low to medium. We thought we had something hooked up wrong, so we spend 2 hours taking it back down, analizing it and putting it back up to find it still moved slower on high than any other fan we have ever seen. It did not hardly move any air/wind outdoors, being it was an outdoor fan.",

We have this in our bedroom and the lowest speed is almost too fast being mounted above our bed. A slower speed would have been preferred. The three faster speeds are fast beyond any practical use! The remote control is handy but you have to manually reverse fan direction at the fan, not on the remote!"

I love the new design to the wall mounted remote that allows a simple battery replacement. I have three other Casablanca's with wall remotes that I put in 2.5 years ago that have an older style wall remote that requires removing the decorative wall plate to change out the batteries. Those remotes and fans are still working fantastically - but I really like the ease to change a battery on the new wall remote included with the Perseus fan.
