                    "Installation was relatively easy, the instructions and the labeling on the wires and the connections were easy to follow and the whole installation took under 2 hours, including the time to disassamble and remove the old ceiling fan. The new fan looks great, the light is fairly bright and has a reasonable light temperature - not too cold, but not too soft either. The remote is already programmed and you won't need to reprogram it unless you have another Minka ceiling fan in your home that you want to control separately. Compared to my previous ceiling fan, this one needs to spin faster to deliver the same airflow, since it has 3 blades, compared to 5, and the blade angle is smaller. This is not an issue as this fan spins very fast when you use the highest setting (6), but it is a bit noisier, though it doesn't bother me much. All in all, this is a great looking fan and the materials and build are high quality. The blades are made of what seems like plastic, but it immitates wood pretty good, and reduces the weight and is more efficient, plus the blades will be much less prone to warping over time. The housing around the light is metal and the base is sturdy and leaves enough room to hide the wiring.",

                    "The fan is super quiet, pretty, and has the Bond Home tech built in so you can control it with an app or your voice assistant. The low setting is very low, which is something I personally like very much, and the high setting moves quite a bit of air. Finally, the remote leaves something to be desired as it is too easy to accidentally change the fan's direction and you cannot dim the light with it (must be done in the app). I think it is fair to knock a star off for this because I think a product like this is at its best when it is full featured out of the box. While wifi setup is pretty simple, not everyone has the patience for it or is comfortable with having connected devices. Overall very happy with this purchase despite the remote.",

If you need a lot of light you will need to install canned light with it. We put one in our bedroom, and itâs perfect. In our second bedroom we added lighting so that would be helpful if we had an office in there, or say a child needed to do homework in there. UPDATE: Donât buy the wall control. It has a horrible bright blue light that you CAN NOT turn off. When I say bright, I mean you wonât be able to sleep bright! Who could come up with such a bad idea.

We knew what we were getting in to with the light based on other reviews here (itâs completely useless except as a nightlight) but were disappointed to find that it also doesnât function well as a fan. At least the two-bladed version just doesnât move much air so you have to put it on high just to get any kind of reasonable airflow and then itâs sort of loud (the motor makes a humming sound on high, itâs totally silent on low or medium).

                    " Not much of a problem to install. I did it myself, but I would recommend an assistant. Use commonsense with safety to make a secure and strong mount and donât skip the safety hanging cable to the ceiling joist. I had to knock off a star because of the dismal lighting; nearly useless. Otherwise, it works fine so far and looks fantastic. My grandson absolutely loves it. One reviewer mentioned a remote control, but that must be a different ceiling fan because there is no sign of one with this product. With past reviews making note of the fan failing to work, weâll wait and see how long this one will work and Iâll post an update if necessary.",

                    " I purchased this fan for looks over functionality and it did not disappoint. It looks awesome in my sonâs room. I was pleasantly surprised that it had a built in light. The light is not very bright, but does the trick. The fan itself has multiple speeds and a reverse function for winter. My only gripe about this fan is the lack of a remote control which is normally found on cheaper Home Depot models. However, I had this fan professionally installed and the electrician was able to setup two wall switches; one switch controls the light (on and off) and another switch controls the fan (on and off).",

The motor would start up ok then it would freeze. So I took the fan to an authorized dealer to see if they could get the light off but even they could not. So I returned it and bought the exact same fan again and the new replacement which was put together by the electrician worked like a charm with no issues.

                    "This is not the best quality. The bad, blades are plastic, look ok, but for $199, dollars the price should reflect a upper level fan. The install was difficult, the remote transmitter has to fit in the canopy, VERY tight fit even with placing the wires up in the wiring box. In order to test the fan operation the switch housing has to be installed. Does not say that anywhere in the instructions. Lastly, the LED light did not work. Tested the electricity down to the LED, all looked fine but the light would not work. Looked at the fan companieâs warranty, that basically says, if there is a defective part, you have to send it back to the dealer. So, I got to put the fan all together, then take it apart, re-box it, and take it back to UPS. Waste of time. I canât in good conscience say that this is a good buy for the money. I could get a whole lot more fan for the money. That being said, I was willing to pay even more for the right fan. I liked the look of the fan, but will have to reconsider what my next purchase after having to return this one.",

                    "I have installed every imaginable fan design from A to Z and I really wanted to enjoy this fan. Unboxing was like \"this is a really nice fan and the manufacturing is much better than average\". Fit and finish of all the parts was impressive. It looked great installed on the new patio -used a heavy duty mounting box and the included downrod. First run had wobble on all three speeds. Used the balance kit per the instructions to no avail -the balance clip had zero positive change on the wobble and only worsened the condition no matter the position or blade placement. So here's the bottom line. Ceiling fans are no picnic to install -the next time I open a fan box and fins a balance kit, I'll return it immediately. There are manufactures that have addressed this ridiculous issue correctly. I'll be buying from them and live with the fact that they're not as attractive as Kichler.",

The ceiling thickness is 3/8\" and there is a gap that is not killed out using the trim ring. This may be okay for interior apps but this fan is rated for damp conditions ... why we bought it. The canopy is fixed (support screws on each side). Hmmm, get out the caulking. You should not have to do that. Installed many fans and thought we'd try a different brand. Will switch back. Poor product and customer service. Tried accessing customer service on Kichler.com. Looks like you need to call your dealer first and they will give you the phone number if needed. A big run around and don't think Amazon would be doing thatð. Over the time limit for a return otherwise would definitely return it",

                    "I have a few things I dislike about this fan. If you have a fan that uses one switch for a light and one for a fan, the control unit forces you to use just one switch to operate both, then you have to use the remote if you want one or the other on. Also the light is NOT dimmable because of this, but the description says it is. There is no dimming function on the remote.This is extremely annoying because the light is ridiculously bright as you can see from the picture. If you hard wired the light to your wall switch and installed a dimmer, that might work, but the remote would no longer work for the light. Also mine appears to have been a returned item, not new. It was not damaged but there were open packages inside and the wiring for the control unit was very frayed. Very disappointed for what's supposed to be a high end ceiling fan",

The 48 inch fan had great RPM's and a great wind/breeze maker but was just not wide enough to cover our deck at the lake. So we opted for this 60 inch outdoor fan. We went to install it, on a 4 foot down pole, like the Hampton Bay 48 inch and found, unlike all other standard fans, it takes a 1/2 inch rod instead of the industry standard 3/8's inch rod. Well, they don't make one so we had to custom make one out of a 48 inch galvanized steel pole for plumbing. That worked fine.",
                    "However, once we had it installed, thats when we found the most disappointing thing. Unlike ALL ceiling fans we have owned for more than 25-30 years, this fan, ON HIGH, moved like most fans on low to medium. We thought we had something hooked up wrong, so we spend 2 hours taking it back down, analizing it and putting it back up to find it still moved slower on high than any other fan we have ever seen. It did not hardly move any air/wind outdoors, being it was an outdoor fan.",

The remote control is handy but you have to manually reverse fan direction at the fan, not on the remote!"

I love the new design to the wall mounted remote that allows a simple battery replacement. I have three other Casablanca's with wall remotes that I put in 2.5 years ago that have an older style wall remote that requires removing the decorative wall plate to change out the batteries. Those remotes and fans are still working fantastically - but I really like the ease to change a battery on the new wall remote included with the Perseus fan.

One potential issue with the design is that they, unlike a typical fan, would be difficult or impossible to clean internally. (To eliminate that issue, I purchased some 3M Filtrete HEPA cloth and cut round \"filters\" to cover each of the intake suctions. When it's time to clean, I'll simply cut new filters to fit. Since each fan is in a location not frequented by guests, the white filters stuck on each side of the base are irrelevant to me. The \"filters\" can be easily removed.)

                    "This is a nice upgrade from the really cheap stand fans. Looks nice in the living. Old fan was the cheap stand up fan with the cross or x feet and flimsy metal that bends way too easy. This new fan is mostly plastic but thick enough. I like it doesn't take up as much floor space. It stands tall enough but you won't be able to raise it higher if you have a need for that. I don't. I got the bluetooth version. The app works great. All buttons work from the app. Has a sleep mode. The app also allows you to add multiple fans. Nice feature. It it on the quiet side as others have said. This is also convenient for the living room while watching tv. Not the cheapest but definitely not the most expensive. I think the value for the money is spot on."

                    "Wow! Looks nice and it blows a lot of air compared to my previous fan and the taotronics fan. Bluetooth is pretty neat. Only con I had with this is that mine has a rattle. It seems like its a BUILD issue where the frame of the fan, its not properly screwed tightly or glued. If I apply pressure to the top of the fan slightly, the rattle stops. If I let go, it rattles. Funny, I thought about tapping the back of the fan. And to my surprise, it stopped rattling. Once I turn it off for a few hours it'll rattle agin or if I move it. Either I got a defective one or it's like that for all of them. Requested amazon for an advance replacement. Will update review to 4 if the replacement fixes it.",
                    "Now, I only gave it a 3, a 4 if the rattling stops. For a 5, the last con is that the angle that it oscillates is limited. Imagine your fingers and hand was slammed on and then you tried to make a V with your index and middle finger. Yeah, its like a 30-45 degree angle lol.",
                    "EDIT: After receiving a relacement, the rattle from the frame is gone! Tested both together and it looks like it's going up to a 4. To add, I wish the oscillating angle was a little more, but other than that, solid fan. Check your fan for a frame rattle on the lowest speed. You can also put a little pressure on the top of the fan to see if the sound changes.",

It's reasonably quiet and it oscillates quite far (close to 180 degrees) so it can cover a room. I like the cleanable filter. Fans that I have purchased without a filter get noisy and/or stop working after one summer season. This fan keeps working for several years if you clean the filter when it gets dirty.

There is no base like other tower fans so the bottom fan blows at almost ground level (photo is of the fan next to my old Lasko fan). This is mainly an issue if you plan on using it at night and have a bed that is more than 2.5 feet off the ground (about the size of the lower fan). The biggest problem I have with this item is that Amazon changes the price constantly. I bought the item at $50, it immediately dropped $5 and continued to drop to $35 over a weeks time. They refused to refund me. I went to buy another and after checking out and canceling the item to change my payment method, they immediately changed the price on me to $72. I wouldnât buy this item unless the price is under $40. Will be returning the first one I bought."

                    "This is a great fan. I did have an electrician install it as it was going over my so-called island. I did have another person put the fan together but unfortunately when the electrician tried to install it would not work and he could not take the fan light off to see what was the issue. The motor would start up ok then it would freeze. So I took the fan to an authorized dealer to see if they could get the light off but even they could not. So I returned it and bought the exact same fan again and the new replacement which was put together by the electrician worked like a charm with no issues. I like the fan because it does not move my recipe papers or recipe book pages. The light is also very good and bright. I would definitely recommend this product."

The problem is that after they have been in use for some time they start getting really noisy. This seems to be due to the inner cylinder spinning off balance and causing rattling, vibration, and whine. At first I thought it was due to dust build on on the internal cylinder, but then I tried cleaning it by blowing it out with an air compressor, being sure not to spin the blade at high RPMs. No joy. Continues to rattle, vibrate, buzz, and whine. ALL of the units (and I have 3 42in and 1 33in have this issue. Due to this, I would not recommend unless you use it for light use."

The description and history of these products I was expecting this thing to more air like no other. I expected that the lowest setting would be more than enough for my bedroom based on description saying this unit would push air 70' away.",

The whole design of the curved vent to distribute the air a more of 180 degree is both a benefit and curse. It is great for the middle of the room but when you need it to hit a specific spot you are getting just a small portion of that 180 degree hitting it while the rest is dispersed everywhere else."

It offers great circulation and it was much needed during the hot summer months with no air conditioning. I also like the remote so I keep it near my bed. Note I live in a studio apartment; I'm not sure how it would work in a larger house but for me, it worked for a 503 square foot apartment. It does get a bit loud on the high setting for when I was trying to watch TV or a movie so I would just change it to a lower setting. Lastly, I am constantly running this fan every night and have not run into any issues."

I've had it for over a year now and it runs continuously most of the time.",

We have a fair amount of computer equipment and this little fan does a good job of discretely circulating air from the hallway into the room. It's quiet on its lowest setting and tolerable on the next setting up. The two higher speeds make the squirrel cage blower whine loudly enough that I never use those speeds. Overall it's noisy for what I'd expect from a Vornado. I know tower fans are generally this way, but I was hoping for better."

However, we haven't had any of the durability or noise problems others complained about. The mode-cycling power button is sleek, simple, and gives a little dash of modernity to what would otherwise be a very plain fan, and while it doesn't shoot a very wide cone of air, what it blows is very strong - once the fan was well-targeted, I was getting chilly in the middle of summer. That's what we're looking for here!"

I was NOT happy, my husband says my face was absolute rage. Buuut I had been using it off and on all day, and for a long stretch of time when it died.

                    "This machine really is wonderful. I live in Arizona and is very dry and hot so having the misting fan is super helpful, it truly does lower the temperature by about 30Â° if youâre in the direct spray. If youâre standing too close, you will get wet, obviously itâs spraying water. I use this in my aviary to keep my birds cool and they love it. I really do wish there was a way to control the flow of water though, make the mist finer or Be able to control how many nozzles are missing water at a time, currently itâs just on or off no ability to control the volume of water coming through it, if you try to turn the hose down Itâs simply stoppes mistng and starts dripping. I let this run constantly and for the heat of the day, 6 to 8 hours. In the evening everything in there is pretty drenched. I donât need as much water as air movement, so adjustable sprays would be super helpful, But otherwise, really fantastic."

                    " So far, so good. The Lasko Misting Fan works well. I could definitely feel the difference when the unit is running, opposed to when it is not. I loaded pictures of the temperature difference, within the first 10 minutes of use. I tried adjusting the water pressure to decrease the amount of moisture that was left on the deck. I moved it back as well, but it still seemed to saturate things in spite of. Iâll keep working on it and will update this review if I find a way to resolve it. Overall, Iâm happy with the purchase."

Imagine vacuum cleaner like noise. Oh well, it at least seemed to be working really well, you could really feel airflow in the bathroom, it was like air was being sucked out of the heating vent. It actually created a kind of pleasant breeze. After being in the attic for an hour on a hot day it was pretty wonderful.",
                    "Then I went to take a shower. I instantly knew something was wrong, the door wouldn't close. Something must be stuck in it, I checked everywhere but nope. Then it dawned on me, the fan was drawing so much air that the door was having trouble closing against the wall of air the fan was sucking into the room. \"Small price to pay for a good fan\" I naÃ¯vely thought as I switched off the fan and closed the bathroom door. I turned on the fan once more and started getting ready for my shower when I heard a loud bang. I glanced at the fan, no everything was good with it. Then I saw it, my heavy metal heater vent had been the only way for air to come in and the fan had heartlessly ripped it out of the wall so it could consume more valuable air."

                    "I live in a 24 year old mobile home. And as you out there in my position know it is HARD to find mobile home parts. So when our 20 + something fan broke for the guest bathroom we were shocked to find that Home Depot and lowes both didn't have one that would work in our home. We have a vent that shoots straight up (vertical) into the roof. And most vents now have a left or right (horizontal) curvature to the vent. So when we found this one we were thrilled it was the right kind. One that just shoots straight up. Now the fan is a little louder than we hoped for however after careful consideration we are glad it is. Have you ever been to a house where the guest bathroom is so close to the main family room you don't feel comfortable, thinking someone can hear you using the restroom?? Well problem solved. This fan is just the right amount of loud so you don't hear a thing. And our house HAS a bathroom right off of the living room---to close for comfort. So in my opinion this fan is perfect. The outside of it is beige/cream not white. And the base is pretty wide at 8inches. But fits perfectly. Again, it is loud but I'm sure my guests appreciate the loud \"cover\" for them to do what they have to do and not be embarrassed. I have had several get togethers and almost everyone has used the fan to mask their private affairs. Glad I got it. Hope this helped. I have inserted a photo of installed fan, hopefully it comes through alright."

                    "I'm slagging this item because it was promoted as \"variable speed.\" I bought it along with the ILG8SFSC speed control, which created an unacceptably loud hum in the motor and caused intense vibration in the fan across the entire range of variability. The fan by itself operates as expected without excessive noise, but now I'm stuck with a single-speed fan that I could have bought a lot cheaper. If you need variable speed buy a fan with 3-speed motor made in the USA. I'd be happy to have spent an extra $100 on something more suitable"

                    "Works great. Put it on a thermostat. Very quiet and cools excellent. Actually bought a second one to add to the shop. Dropped the ceiling temperature from about 130Â° (building is uninsulated ... big mistake) to about 105Â°F. This makes a tremendous difference in the shop. Can't wait to see what the second fan will do. But, the ad is a little misleading if you don't read closely. The fan does NOT come with a cord or thermostat. I did recommend one to my brother and he thought the same thing ... that it comes with a cord and thermostat. Not sure if he ever believed me or not when I told him it doesn't."
